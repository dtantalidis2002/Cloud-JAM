# Cloud-JAM

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rushup/Cloud-JAM/master/JAM-TOP.jpg)

Cloud-JAM is the product accelerator (production grade solution) of ST functional pack P-NUCLEO-CLD1 that combines:

-  NUCLEO F401RE
-  NUCLEO SHIELD IKS01A2
-  NUCLEO SHIELD NFC01A1
-  NUCLEO SHIELD IDW01M1

At a firmware level the Cloud-Jam works the same way as those 4 hardware combined.

So any project or binary created for STM32F401RE microcontroller can run or be debugged on the Cloud- JAM.

You can find functional pack applications and sources [HERE](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/p-nucleo-cld1.html)
